# Demonstration: Solving a Small Problem
To demonstrate the various components involved in software, we will work on
implementation, testing, and documentation of the following problem:

```
Given a string of roman numerals, create a function which returns an
integer.
```

Eric Earl will lead implementation, Josh Teves will lead testing, and
Dylan Nielson will lead documentation. They may bounce ideas and ask for
feedback from each other.
